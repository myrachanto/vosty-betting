      <h1>How to Optimize your site to rank well on search results(SEO)</h1>
      <p>
          Search Engine Optimization may be one of the crankiest thing to deal with in marketing. Marketers take this as challange and demand hundred of dollars to thousands inoder to optimize a site
      </p>
      <p>In this article I will try and and cover as much as I can to exhaust all there is to as far as SEO is concerned. I will not go to finner details but I will deliver as much as I can.</p>
      <p>So! are you ready for a search engine optimization bootcamp?</p>
      <p>SEO is a massive topic and to ensure your site ranks well you have work cut out for you.<br/>
      Lets begin!
      </p>
      <p>To have a clear view what SEO entails we are going to categorize it into three major categories name</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Site Optimization</li>
          <li>Linking and back linking</li>
          <li>Social media marketing</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Before we embark on those three majors areas of SEO. I need some few fact straight</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Linking especially back linking(sites linkign to your sites) is the king of the game.(Cheers to those who are familiar with chess)- those who haven't played chess lossing the king implies you are a gonner in no specific terms-- oh you can win but the probability of winning diminishes to 5%</li>
          <li>You need to know and research your keywords in order to optimize your site otherwise dont bother building it</li>
          <li>Good luck!</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Site otpimization of keywords</h2>
      <p>In very page you need to optimize atleast 4 items to win this game</p>
      <p>--AGGGGHHHH! it just occured to me am bumbling about optimization and we might not be on the same page! In that case let me use an example!</p>
      <p>let say you sell women clothes online and you want to optimize your page title this is how i probably do it</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Do some keyword research on Women clothings -well use google keyword planner all you need is a google account and then login!</li>
          <li>so here a list: you might come up with a better list
              <ul>
                  <li>Shopping</li>
                  <li>Women clothes</li>
                  <li>Comfort dress</li>
                  <li>official ware you get the idea so</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>So this is probably how I would frame it <strong>Best place for shopping women clothes online at affordable price</strong></li>
          <li>Don't over do it- the keyword optimization thing! Remember the key is to ensure that you provide a good user experience(plus thats all search engine are trying to achive anyways)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you over did it and people visit your site and finds that what they are reading make no sence they wil bounce(leave your site immediately) and trust you dont want such a record associated with your site because search engines like google uses user experince to rank pages on the search results</p>
      <p>The higher the rate of bounce rate the low you are ranked!</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Back to the topic at hand - Items to optimize in a page</p>
      <h2>The title</h2>
      <p>It shows on the tab bar or in the search results as link to the website the the results</p>
      <p>You probably have almost 150 characters to work with and only 100 are visible on the search results. So give it you best shot and like earlier on will demonstrate with an example</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Let Imagine you are in the web development industry and your kewords are:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Website</li>
              <li>Development</li>
              <li>Designs</li>
              <li>Custom, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>SO this is how I would probably craft it</li>
          <li><strong>"Best Ecommerce Developers| Custom website Designers at an Afforadable Price"</strong></li>

      </ul>
      <p>Notice how I capitalize the first letter of every <b>keyword</b> right? This is meant for suffers as they scan through search results the words can pop up to them.</p>

      <h2>Meta title</h2>
      <p>THis appears as description on the search results. The same procedure we have employed above whould apply here too the only diffence you have a range of 150 - 200 characters to work with</p>
      <h2>H1 and H2 tags</h2>
      <p>Every page must have one h1 tag and atleast one h2 tags. Optimize those as well but now consider readabilty and user experience. Use the example we used on the women clothe store title optimization.</p>
      <h2>The content</h2>
      <p>In previous years content used to  be the king of search engine optimaztion. Well its true to a certain degree- I mean you to need content in order to infuse and optimize your kewords to the page, but <strong>linking especially back linking</strong> is the King of SEO</p>
      <h2><strong>Linking and Back linking</strong></h2>
      <p>Link your website well for easy anvigation through. Also link your page using keywords to navigate through various pages. This the fast bit of linking.</p>
      <p>Get links from other website to link back to you</p>
      <p>This might be the king of search engine optimaztion but might be hardest and out of control compared to other bits of SEO</p>
      <p>People might allow you to write articles and post them on their website and link them back to you. Use those opportunities because they are rare</p>
      <h2>Social medial Marketing</h2>
      <p>Well this might be the easiest in the SEO business but you should note that their role is to create awareness but not much help with link building</p>
      <p>Create facebook page for you buisness, twitter account, linkedin , Instagram among others</p>
      <h2>Summary of the SEO bootcamp</h2>
      <p>Well this article does not exhaust the SEO brief but it give an overview of what you need in SEO industry.</p>
      <p>I sure do hope you have a developer who built your site with SEO in mind otherwise you have a rougher journey ahead of you</p>

      <br/>
      <p><strong>GOOD LUCK!</strong></p>
